# 🚀 Production Deployment Guide - Generic Medical Specialties Update

## ✅ Changes Successfully Pushed to GitHub

**Commit:** `54c9f0c` - feat: Add generic medical specialties support across platform  
**Repository:** Your main branch now contains all the updated code

## 📋 What Was Updated

### 1. **Job Reviews System**
- Added medical specialty dropdown (27 specialties) to submit/edit forms
- Added specialty bubbles to job reviews display with readable names
- Updated filtering to support specialty filtering

### 2. **Practice Profile Page** 
- Replaced radiology-specific "modalities" with generic "medical specialty"
- Updated practice settings to match job reviews form
- Changed from radiology-focused to multi-specialty

### 3. **Resident Profile ("My Profile")**
- Added medical specialty selection dropdown
- Updated "Current Residency Program" → "Current/Former Residency Program"
- Maintained existing photo and bio functionality

### 4. **Terminology Updates**
- Changed "Teleradiology" → "Telemedicine" across all forms
- Updated "residents" → "physicians" in generic contexts
- Improved specialty name formatting (e.g., "family_medicine" → "Family Medicine")

## 🗄️ Database Migration Required

### For PostgreSQL Production Database:

1. **Backup your database first:**
   ```bash
   pg_dump $DATABASE_URL > backup_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).sql
   ```

2. **Run the production migration:**
   ```bash
   python production_migration.py
   ```

### What the Migration Does:
- ✅ Adds `specialty` column to `job_review` table
- ✅ Adds `medical_specialty` column to `resident_profile` table
- ✅ Adds `medical_specialty` column to `employer_profile` table
- ✅ Removes `modalities` column from `employer_profile` table
- ✅ Updates existing 'Teleradiology' records to 'Telemedicine'

### PostgreSQL Compatibility:
- ✅ All SQL statements tested for PostgreSQL compatibility
- ✅ Uses standard VARCHAR(100) data types
- ✅ Proper transaction handling
- ✅ Safe to run multiple times (idempotent)

## 🔧 Environment Requirements

### No New Environment Variables Needed
Your existing environment variables will work fine:
- `DATABASE_URL` - Your PostgreSQL connection string
- All other existing variables remain unchanged

### Dependencies
No new Python dependencies were added - all changes use existing libraries.

   ```

2. **Database Rollback:**
   ```bash
   psql $DATABASE_URL < your_backup_file.sql
   ```

## 🎯 Key Benefits After Deployment

1. **Multi-Specialty Support**: Platform now supports all 27 medical specialties
2. **Better User Experience**: Consistent terminology and professional presentation
3. **Improved Data Quality**: Structured specialty data instead of free text
4. **Enhanced Filtering**: Users can filter by specific medical specialties

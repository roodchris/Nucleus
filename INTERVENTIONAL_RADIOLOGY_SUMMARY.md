# Interventional Radiology Job Type Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully added "Interventional radiology" as a new job type option to the radiology moonlighting job board. The implementation is complete and tested across all workflows.

## Changes Made

### 1. Models (`app/models.py`)
- Added `INTERVENTIONAL_RADIOLOGY = "interventional_radiology"` to the `OpportunityType` enum
- Positioned between `TELE_DIAGNOSTIC_INTERPRETATION` and `CONSULTING_OTHER` for logical ordering

### 2. Forms (`app/forms.py`)
- Added `(OpportunityType.INTERVENTIONAL_RADIOLOGY.value, "Interventional radiology")` to `OPP_TYPE_CHOICES`
- This automatically updates all forms that use this choice list

### 3. Database Migration
- Created `migrate_interventional_radiology.py` script for safe database updates
- Handles both PostgreSQL (enum value addition) and SQLite (automatic support)
- Created `INTERVENTIONAL_RADIOLOGY_MIGRATION.md` with detailed migration instructions

### 4. Templates
- No changes needed - templates use dynamic rendering with `.value.replace('_', ' ').title()`
- Automatically displays "Interventional Radiology" correctly

## Features Implemented

### ✅ Job Creation
- Employers can select "Interventional radiology" when creating new opportunities
- Form validation works correctly with the new option

### ✅ Job Filtering
- Users can filter opportunities by "Interventional radiology" type
- Search functionality includes the new job type

### ✅ Job Display
- All opportunity listings show "Interventional Radiology" correctly
- Detail pages, calendar views, and admin dashboards all support the new type
- Proper formatting with title case and space replacement

### ✅ Database Integration
- PostgreSQL enum type updated with new value
- SQLite automatically supports the new value
- Migration script is idempotent (safe to run multiple times)

### ✅ Backend Workflows
- Opportunity creation, editing, and deletion all work with the new type
- Application system supports interventional radiology opportunities
- Messaging system works with the new job type
- Email notifications include the correct job type

## Testing Results

All tests passed successfully:
- ✅ Enum value exists and is correct
- ✅ Form choices include interventional radiology
- ✅ Opportunity creation works with new type
- ✅ Opportunity filtering works correctly
- ✅ Display formatting is correct
- ✅ Enum ordering is proper
- ✅ Database operations work correctly

## Migration Instructions

### For Development
1. The migration script has already been run locally
2. All functionality is working in the development environment

### For Production
1. Deploy the updated code
2. Run: `python migrate_interventional_radiology.py`
3. Verify the new option appears in job creation forms
4. Test filtering and display functionality

## Files Modified
- `app/models.py` - Added enum value
- `app/forms.py` - Added form choice
- `migrate_interventional_radiology.py` - Migration script (new)
- `INTERVENTIONAL_RADIOLOGY_MIGRATION.md` - Migration guide (new)
- `INTERVENTIONAL_RADIOLOGY_SUMMARY.md` - This summary (new)

## Files NOT Modified
- All template files - they use dynamic rendering
- API endpoints - they use the enum automatically
- Email templates - they use dynamic rendering
- Admin interfaces - they use dynamic rendering

## Next Steps
1. Deploy to production
2. Run the migration script
3. Test all functionality in production
4. Monitor for any issues

The implementation is complete and ready for production deployment!
